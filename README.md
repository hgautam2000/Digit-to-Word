Digit-to-Word
=============

A small Java program that converts an integer to its corresponding word. The program can still be made significantly better, because it can only identify numbers form 0-10. There is a simple solution, but it is a tedious one. If anyone of you can come up with a solution, feel free me to message me as I am open to anything!
